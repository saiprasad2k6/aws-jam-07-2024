## Background
You are a DevOps Engineer at a Multi-National company, ABC Limited. Recently, there was a security audit and the auditor
found that few of the AWS Lambda functions are not deployed in a VPC. As per your Organisation's security guidelines,
all AWS Lambda functions should be in a secured environment. Hence, it is a security violation and your team of AWS
Experts need to re-configure and deploy all the lambda functions in a VPC. Also, we need to make sure that any existing
functionality is not broken as there is a customer demo next week.

A member of your team has been assigned this task and they have re-configured the lambda functions within AWS VPC.
However, due to an emergency your team member has to take leave before fully testing the application. The Application
team is getting ready for demo and during dry run found issues with Lambda function. Your manager has reached out to you
for your help in completing this task before customer demo. Ready to Dive in?
